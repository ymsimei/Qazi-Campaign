            <h3>
              Awais Qazi is running for General Assembly in New Jersey District 29.
            </h3>
            <p>
              Day by day, it is becoming more and more clear that we have a government that is not currently working in the best interest of the American people. It is time for ordinary people, like you and me, to make our voices heard. We need more diverse candidates to run for office on every level: Local, County, State, and Federal. We need to have communities get together periodically and have discussions about the issues that matter to them and to ensure that those conversations are conveyed to elected officials so that they can best represent the district. We need to ensure that more people are encouraged to become active participants in their communities.
            </p>
            <p>
              The only thing that is stronger than the influence of money in politics is the influence of strong communities standing together and speaking up for the issues that matter to them.This is how we make America work for us.
