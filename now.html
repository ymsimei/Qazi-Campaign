              Share our graphics on Facebook! Our graphics show how we contrast from the existing legislators. We need as many people to see them as possible. New graphics will be posted at least once a week. Once you see them, make sure you share them with your friends and post them in local groups. Get at least five friends to also share each post so we can grow quickly.
